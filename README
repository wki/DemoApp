This is just a stupid demo application, not more.

I use it to learn Catalyst. Every hint is welcome :-)

To run it, you will need
  - Catalyst::Controller::Combine
  - Catalyst::View::ByCode
plus some more CPAN modules, have a try!

-------

Just some ideas...

as a first try, Schema::Result::Product defines some extras for HTML::FormFu generation.

Idea: create a form from a ResultSet...

    my $rs = $c->model('DB::Product')
               ->search({},{prefetch => ['sizes', 'color']});
    
    my $form = $rs->generate_form_fu({maybe some extras...});
    # do something with this HTML::FormFu object...

Pre-Requisites:
 - load_components() in every Result Class must do something more
 - we need a new Component, e.g. DBIx::Class::FormFuBuilder.pm

Schema generation:
  __PACKAGE__->form_fu_extras(column_name => {...});
  
  $rs->generate_form_fu(...);
  

---> see DBIx::Class::ResultSetProxy !!!
